**Last Updated:** January 2025

## 1. PRICING OVERVIEW

### Pricing Philosophy

UnifyData.AI's pricing is built on three foundational principles:

**1. Value-Based, Not Cost-Based**
Our pricing reflects the business value delivered - time saved, insights gained, and decisions accelerated - not just infrastructure costs. Each tier is designed to deliver 5-10× ROI based on employee time savings alone.

**2. Transparent & Predictable**
No hidden fees, no surprise charges. Customers know exactly what they're paying for and can accurately forecast costs as they scale. Overage pricing is clear and reasonable.

**3. Growth-Aligned Pricing**
We grow when our customers grow. Our per-data-source model means pricing scales with actual usage and business complexity, not arbitrary user counts that penalize collaboration.

---

### Pricing Model Explanation

**Why Per Data Source Instead of Per User?**

Traditional SaaS pricing (per seat/user) penalizes collaboration and creates artificial barriers to value. UnifyData.AI uses **per data source pricing** because:

✓ **Aligns with actual value:** More data sources = more comprehensive insights = more value
✓ **Encourages adoption:** Unlimited users means everyone can benefit, creating true data democratization
✓ **Predictable scaling:** Adding a new system is a conscious business decision, not an arbitrary headcount trigger
✓ **No collaboration tax:** Teams can onboard freely without procurement friction
✓ **Reflects true cost:** Infrastructure scales with data volume and sources, not user logins

**Example:**
- **Company A:** 200 employees, 10 data sources → Professional Plan (€799/month)
- **Company B:** 50 employees, 15 data sources → Professional Plan (€799/month)

Both pay the same because they're getting similar platform value, even though traditional per-seat pricing would charge Company A 4× more.

### Competitive Positioning

**Market Position:** Premium value with mid-market accessibility

| Competitor | Model | Typical Cost (100 users) | Positioning |
|------------|-------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Glean** | €15-25/user/month | €1,500-2,500/month | Premium search |
| **Guru** | €15/user/month | €1,500/month | Knowledge management |
| **Notion AI** | €10/user/month | €1,000/month | Document AI (limited) |
| **Custom Dev** | One-time + maintenance | €50K-200K+ | Bespoke solution |
| **UnifyData.AI** | €799/month (Pro) | €799/month | **Full platform** |

**Our Advantage:** Comprehensive data unification at 40-60% lower cost than seat-based competitors, with 10× broader scope than point solutions.

**Enterprise-Level Query Examples:**

**Query 1: Risk Intelligence**
*"Identify all Q4 deals over €500K that have churn risk based on support tickets, product usage, and sentiment from communications"*

**UnifyData Logic:**
1. Finds Salesforce opportunities: Q4, stage: Negotiation/Closed Won, value >€500K (23 deals)
2. Cross-references Gainsight health scores (filtering: trending down or "at risk")
3. Analyzes Zendesk ticket volume/severity for these accounts (last 90 days)
4. Checks product usage data from analytics (Mixpanel/Amplitude: login frequency, feature adoption)
5. Runs sentiment analysis on Slack/email communications with these clients
6. Reviews CSM notes in Salesforce for manual flags
7. Checks if renewal is approaching (within 120 days)

**Result:** 4 high-risk accounts identified (€1.8M ARR at risk)

**Detailed Output:**
- **Account A** (€600K ARR): 12 critical support tickets (avg resolution: 18 days), product usage down 40%, negative sentiment in 8/15 recent emails, renewal in 45 days
- **Account B** (€450K ARR): Health score dropped from 85 to 62, 3 executive stakeholders left company (LinkedIn data), low feature adoption
- **Account C** (€420K ARR): NPS score: 3 (detractor), 6 escalated tickets, competing product mentioned in Slack channel

**Action Taken:**

---

**Query 2: Competitive Intelligence**
*"Show me all opportunities where we lost to Competitor X, including reasons, deal characteristics, and common objections"*

**UnifyData Logic:**
1. Searches Salesforce: Stage = Closed Lost, Competitor = "Competitor X" (last 12 months)
2. Extracts close reason notes and objections
3. Analyzes Gong call transcripts for objection themes
4. Identifies deal characteristics (industry, size, region, champion persona)
5. Checks if price was mentioned as objection (Proposify proposal data)
6. Reviews product feature gaps mentioned (cross-ref with Jira roadmap)
7. Analyzes email threads for decision-maker concerns

**Result:** 18 lost deals to Competitor X (€2.4M total pipeline)

**Insight Summary:**
- **Top objection:** "Better API documentation and developer experience" (14/18 deals)
- **Average deal size:** €133K (vs our avg: €95K → they win bigger deals)
- **Industries:** 61% FinTech, 22% HealthTech (vertical strength)
- **Champion persona:** 83% VP Engineering or CTO (technical buyers)
- **Price:** Only 3 deals mentioned price (not main factor)

---

**Query 3: Operational Efficiency**
*"Which internal processes have the most bottlenecks based on Slack mentions, ticket data, and project delays?"*

**UnifyData Logic:**
1. Analyzes Slack channels for frustration keywords ("stuck," "waiting," "blocked," "delayed")
2. Identifies frequent @mentions of specific teams or individuals (bottleneck indicators)
3. Cross-references Jira: tickets with >14 day cycle time, frequently reassigned, high comment counts
4. Reviews support tickets (Zendesk) categorized as "internal tools" or "process issues"
5. Checks calendar data (Calendly) for meeting density (sign of coordination overhead)
6. Analyzes email threads with >10 participants (decision-making delays)

**Result:** Top 3 bottlenecks identified

**Bottleneck 1: Legal Contract Review**
- 127 Slack mentions of "waiting on legal" (last 60 days)
- Average contract review time: 18 days (industry benchmark: 5 days)
- 42 deals delayed in Salesforce due to contract issues
- €3.2M pipeline aging unnecessarily

**Bottleneck 2: Data Engineering Requests**
- 89 internal tickets for "data access" or "new dashboard"
- Average resolution: 23 days
- 12 teams affected, 67 employees blocked
- Estimated productivity loss: 340 hours/month

**Bottleneck 3: IT Provisioning**
- New employee onboarding: avg 8.5 days for full system access (benchmark: 2 days)
- 34 new hires in last quarter affected
- Reduced productivity in first 2 weeks

**Action Taken:**
- Legal: Hired 2 contract specialists, implemented CLM software (saved 12 days avg review time)
- Data Eng: Deployed UnifyData.AI more broadly (reduced ad-hoc requests by 71%)
- IT: Automated provisioning with Okta workflows (reduced to 1.5 days)
- **Total efficiency gain:** 580 hours/month = €29,000/month saved

## 7. PRICING EVOLUTION & OPTIMIZATION

### Future Pricing Considerations

**Potential Model Enhancements (Year 2-3):**

1. **Usage-Based Pricing Tier** (Pay-as-you-go)
   - €0.05/query (no monthly fee)
   - Target: Very small teams, sporadic users
   - Risk: Unpredictable revenue

2. **Industry-Specific Pricing**
   - FinTech/Healthcare: +20% (compliance overhead)
   - Retail/Hospitality: -10% (lower willingness to pay)
   - Bundled compliance features

3. **Seat-Based Hybrid** (for specific segments)
   - Enterprise: Base fee + €20/user (for >200 users)
   - Captures value from very large deployments

4. **Freemium Tier** (for virality)
   - 1 data source, 1 user, 100 queries/month
   - Conversion target: 5-10% to Starter within 90 days
   - Risk: Support costs, low-quality leads

**Magnitude:** 5-10% annually (tied to inflation + value adds)
