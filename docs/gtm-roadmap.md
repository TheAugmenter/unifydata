   - Minimal cash burn (€2K-5K total in Phase 1-2)
   - No paid acquisition until Month 6
   - Founder-led sales & customer success
   - Proof of concept before scaling spend

3. **Beta-First Validation**
   - 10-15 design partners (50% off Year 1 + lifetime 25% discount)
   - Deep product feedback loop
   - Case studies & testimonials from Day 1
   - Prove product-market fit before broad launch

4. **Efficient Scaling (Months 6-18)**
   - Paid ads only after proving organic channels work
   - Hire sales team after founder closes first 30 deals
   - Invest in tools only when processes are proven
   - Target: <6 month CAC payback throughout

5. **Category Leadership (Months 18-24)**

**🛠️ CRM & Sales Automation**

**CRM Selection: HubSpot or Pipedrive**

- Marketing + Sales combined
- Email sequences, automation
- Reporting & analytics

**Why Pipedrive:**
- Simpler, cleaner UI
- More affordable (€15-50/user/month)
- Great for sales-focused teams

**Recommendation:** Start with HubSpot Free, upgrade to Starter (€45/month) when needed

**CRM Setup:**

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. Lead (inbound signup or outbound contact)
2. Qualified (fits ICP, has budget/need/timeline)
3. Demo Scheduled
4. Demo Completed
5. Proposal Sent
6. Negotiation
7. Closed Won / Closed Lost

**Automation:**
- [ ] Email sequences:
  - Trial signup sequence (7 emails over 14 days)
  - Demo no-show sequence (3 emails)
  - Post-demo follow-up (5 emails over 14 days)
  - Closed-lost re-engagement (quarterly check-in)
- [ ] Lead scoring:
  - Company size (50-250 = 10 points, 250+ = 20 points)
  - Industry (B2B SaaS = 15 points, Tech = 10 points)
  - Engagement (opened 3+ emails = 5 points, watched demo video = 10 points)
  - Behavior (connected data source = 20 points, ran 10+ queries = 30 points)
- [ ] Task automation:
  - Demo scheduled → Create "Send prep email" task
  - Demo completed → Create "Send follow-up + proposal" task (same day)
  - 3 days no response → Create "Follow up" task

**Lead Scoring Model:**
- 0-20 points: Cold (nurture with content)
- 21-50 points: Warm (SDR outreach)
- 51-80 points: Hot (prioritize for demo)
- 81-100 points: Urgent (founder calls directly)

**Sales Analytics Dashboard:**
- [ ] Metrics to track:
  - Leads generated (by source: organic, paid, referral)
  - Demos booked & completed
  - Conversion rates (lead → demo → opportunity → customer)
  - Sales cycle length (average days from demo to close)
  - Win rate by source, industry, company size
  - Forecast: Pipeline value by stage

- **Day 14:** Email 3 (case study, social proof)
- **Day 21:** LinkedIn message (break-up)
- **Day 28:** Email 4 (final break-up: "Should I close your file?")

## CONTINGENCY PLANS (What If Things Go Wrong?)

### Scenario 1: Growth Slower Than Expected

**If by Month 12: <80 customers, <€30K MRR**

**Diagnosis:**
- Low traffic? (SEO not working)
- Low conversion? (product not resonating, poor onboarding)
- High churn? (product doesn't deliver value)

**Action Plan:**
1. **Double down on content:**
   - Increase to 4-5 blog posts/week
   - Focus on high-volume keywords
   - Guest post on 10+ platforms

2. **Increase outbound:**
   - Hire SDR earlier (Month 8 vs Month 9)
   - Volume: 300-500 outreach/week (vs 200)

3. **Offer limited-time promotions:**
   - 30% off first year (vs 15%)
   - Extended trials (30 days vs 14 days)

4. **Ask beta customers for referrals:**
   - Incentivize: €200 credit per referral
   - Goal: 10-20 referrals from happy customers

5. **Partner more aggressively:**
   - Recruit 50-100 affiliates (vs 30-50)
   - Offer higher commission (25% vs 20%)

6. **Cut costs:**
   - Pause paid ads if ROAS <2:1
   - Delay hires (stay lean)

---

### Scenario 2: Churn High (>5% monthly)

**Diagnosis:**
- Product not delivering value?
- Poor onboarding?
- Wrong ICP (selling to customers who don't fit)?
- Competitor offering better solution?

**Action Plan:**
1. **Cancel surveys:**
   - Ask every churned customer why they left
   - Identify patterns (price, features, usability, support)

2. **Improve onboarding:**
   - Add 1-on-1 onboarding calls (mandatory for first 50 customers)
   - In-app tutorials (Appcues, Chameleon)
   - Success criteria: Customer runs 10+ queries in first week

3. **Proactive customer success:**
   - Weekly check-ins for first month
   - Usage monitoring: Alert if <5 queries/week
   - Re-engagement campaigns

4. **Feature development:**
   - Prioritize features customers are churning for lack of
   - Fast iteration cycles (weekly releases)

5. **Price tier adjustments:**
   - If price is #1 objection, consider lower-tier plan or usage-based pricing

---

### Scenario 3: CAC Too High (>€800)

**Diagnosis:**
- Paid ads inefficient?
- Sales cycle too long?
- Low trial-to-paid conversion?

**Action Plan:**
1. **Pause paid ads temporarily:**
   - Only spend on proven channels (if Google works, cut LinkedIn)
   - Reduce budget by 50-75%

2. **Focus on organic/content:**
   - SEO typically has CAC <€100 (patient, but works)
   - Community building (free)

3. **Optimize conversion funnel:**
   - A/B test landing pages (goal: 15%+ trial signup rate)
   - A/B test onboarding (goal: 25%+ trial-to-paid)
   - Reduce friction (fewer form fields, faster setup)

4. **Referral program:**
   - Happy customers refer friends (CAC ~€0)
   - Offer: €200 credit for referrer + 20% off for referee

5. **Increase prices:**
   - If CAC is €800, need LTV >€2,400 to maintain 3:1 ratio
   - Consider raising prices by 20-30% (improves unit economics)

---

### Scenario 4: Team Scaling Challenges

**Diagnosis:**
- Bad hires?
- Culture issues?
- Lack of processes?

**Action Plan:**
1. **Hire slower:**
   - Rigorous interview process (4-5 rounds)
   - Trial periods (90-day probation, be willing to part ways)

2. **Invest in onboarding:**
   - 2-week onboarding program (all new hires)
   - Buddy system (pair with veteran employee)

3. **Document processes:**
   - Sales playbook, CS playbook, engineering docs
   - Reduce reliance on tribal knowledge

4. **Culture reinforcement:**
   - Quarterly offsites (team building)
   - Core values posted everywhere
   - Hire for culture fit (not just skills)

5. **Leadership development:**
   - Train first-time managers (many early hires will be)
   - External coaching (consider exec coach for founder)

---

### Scenario 5: Cash Flow Strain

**Diagnosis:**
- Burning cash faster than revenue growth?
- Runway <6 months?

**Action Plan:**
1. **Cut expenses immediately:**
   - Pause all paid ads
   - Freeze hiring
   - Renegotiate vendor contracts
   - Cut non-essential tools

2. **Accelerate revenue:**
   - Annual upfront billing (offer 25% discount for upfront payment)
   - Reach out to warm pipeline (close deals ASAP)
   - Offer limited-time discounts to convert trials

3. **Consider bridge financing:**
   - Angel investors (€50K-200K)
   - Venture debt (if qualified)
   - Revenue-based financing (Lighter Capital, Clearco)

4. **Worst case: Layoffs:**
   - Keep only mission-critical team (founders + 2-3 key people)
   - Be transparent with team
   - Offer severance (if possible)

5. **Reevaluate business model:**
   - Is product-market fit real?
   - Should we pivot?
   - Should we shut down gracefully?

---

## CONCLUSION

This 24-month GTM roadmap is designed for **capital-efficient, sustainable growth** with the option to accelerate via fundraising.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Content-led growth first** (Months 0-6): Build authority before spending on ads
2. **Validate before scaling** (Months 6-12): Prove unit economics before aggressive spend
3. **Enterprise when ready** (Months 12-18): Move upmarket after product maturity
4. **Platform ecosystem** (Months 18-24): Build moat via marketplace & integrations
5. **Category creation** (Months 18-24): Don't just compete, define new category

**Success is NOT guaranteed,** but this roadmap maximizes probability by:
- Starting lean (bootstrap-friendly)
- Validating early (beta program, PMF signals)
- Scaling methodically (only after proving channels work)
- Building defensibility (brand, ecosystem, category leadership)

**By Month 24:** €4.2M ARR, 700 customers, market leadership, optionality to raise or continue bootstrapping to €10M+.
