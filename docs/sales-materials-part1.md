**Speaker Notes:**
```
"Thank you for taking the time to meet with us today. I'm [Name] from
UnifyData.AI. Over the next 15 minutes, I'm going to show you how we're
helping companies like [mention similar company] eliminate data silos and
make their entire organization data-driven.

By the end of this presentation, you'll understand exactly how UnifyData
can save your team hundreds of hours every month and accelerate your
decision-making speed by 10×.

Let me start by asking: How many tools does your company use on a daily
basis? [Pause for response] That's actually pretty typical for a company
your size. And that's exactly the problem we solve."

### SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

**Headline:**
```
Your Team Wastes 20+ Hours Per Week Searching For Information
```

**Key Content (5 Pain Points):**

**1. Data Scattered Across 10-50+ Systems**
```
• Salesforce, HubSpot, Jira, Slack, Teams, Gmail, Drive, Notion, Zendesk...
• Each department has its own tools and "source of truth"
• No unified view of customers, products, or operations
```

**2. 3.5 Hours Per Day Spent Searching** *(IDC Research)*
```
• 20% of work time wasted looking for information
• Context switching between 10+ tools kills productivity
• Knowledge workers spend 2.5 hours/day just searching for data
```

**3. Critical Decisions Delayed by Lack of Data Access**
```
• "Let me have my analyst pull that data" = 3-day delay
• Executives making decisions with incomplete information
• Competitive opportunities missed due to slow insights
```

**4. Knowledge Loss When Employees Leave**
```
• Tribal knowledge walks out the door
• Onboarding new employees takes months (re-learning context)
• Critical information buried in someone's email or Slack
```

**5. Duplicate Work Due to Information Silos**
```
• "I didn't know someone already solved this problem"
• Multiple teams working on same initiatives unknowingly
• Reinventing the wheel costs time and money
```

**Visual Description:**
```
Left side: Frustrated employee at desk, surrounded by floating app logos
(Salesforce, Slack, Gmail, Jira, Drive, etc.) connected by tangled lines
representing data silos.

Right side: Large stat callouts:
• "3.5 hours/day" (in red/warning color)
• "10-50+ tools" (icons scattered)
• "20% of work time" (clock icon showing wasted time)

Bottom: Source citation in small text: "Source: IDC Research, 2024"
```

**Speaker Notes:**
```
"Let me paint a picture that probably sounds familiar. Your sales team is
in Salesforce. Your product team lives in Jira. Your customer success team
is in Zendesk. Everyone's communicating in Slack and email. Documents are
scattered across Google Drive, Notion, and SharePoint.

[Point to visual] When someone needs to answer a simple question like
'Which customers mentioned pricing concerns this quarter?'—they have to
open 5 different tools, search through each one, manually piece together
the answer, and hope they didn't miss anything.

According to IDC Research, the average knowledge worker spends 3.5 hours
per day—that's 20% of their workday—just searching for information. For a
100-person company, that's 350 hours wasted every single day.

And it gets worse. When a key employee leaves, they take years of context
with them. When you're trying to make a critical business decision, you're
often working with incomplete data because no one has time to search across
all systems.

This isn't a people problem. It's a systems problem. And that's exactly
what UnifyData solves."

### SLIDE 3: WHY IT MATTERS

**Headline:**
```
The Hidden Cost of Data Silos: €1.5M+ Lost Annually
```

**Business Impact (4 Key Areas with Calculations):**

**1. Productivity Loss**
```
💰 A 500-person company wastes 2,500 hours/month searching for data
   2,500 hours × €50/hour = €125,000/month = €1.5M/year lost

Visual: Calculator/spreadsheet graphic showing the math
```

**2. Delayed Decision-Making = Missed Opportunities**
```
🐌 Average time to get data for executive decisions: 3-7 days
   By the time you have the answer, the opportunity is gone

   Example: Competitor launches feature while you're "gathering data"

Visual: Timeline showing 7-day delay vs instant with UnifyData
```

**3. Customer Dissatisfaction from Slow Responses**
```
😞 Sales rep can't answer prospect's question on the call
   "Let me get back to you" = deal momentum lost

   Support team can't see full customer history = frustrated customers

Visual: Downward trending NPS/CSAT graph
```

**4. Competitive Disadvantage**
```
🏁 Companies with unified data move 10× faster
   While you're searching, competitors are deciding

   Data-driven companies grow 30% faster (McKinsey)

Visual: Two runners, one far ahead (labeled "Data-driven companies")
```

**Main Visual - Center of Slide:**
```
Large dollar amount in warning color:

        €1.5M
     Lost Annually
  (500-person company)

Below: Bar chart showing cumulative cost breakdown:
• Productivity loss: €1.5M (largest bar, red)
• Missed opportunities: €500K (orange)
• Customer churn: €300K (yellow)
• Duplicate work: €200K (light red)

Total: €2.5M annual impact
```

**Speaker Notes:**
```
"Now let me translate this problem into business terms that matter to you.

[Point to main number] For a 500-person company, data silos cost
approximately €1.5 million per year in pure productivity loss alone. That's
just employees spending time searching instead of doing their actual jobs.

But the real cost is much higher when you factor in everything else:

[Point to timeline] Delayed decision-making means you miss competitive
opportunities. While you're waiting 3-7 days to 'gather the data' for an
executive meeting, your competitor has already launched, already decided,
already moved.

[Point to customer satisfaction] Your customers feel this pain too. When a
prospect asks your sales rep a question and they can't answer it on the
spot—'Let me get back to you'—you've just lost deal momentum. When your
support team can't see the full customer history across systems, the
customer has to repeat themselves. Frustrating experiences.

[Point to competitive disadvantage] McKinsey research shows that
data-driven companies grow 30% faster than their peers. The difference?
They can access their data instantly. They make decisions in hours, not
days.

The question isn't whether you can afford to solve this problem. The
question is: Can you afford NOT to?"

**3 Key Benefits (Below Screenshot):**
```
✓ Search across 20+ data sources from one interface

✓ Complete data lineage—see exactly where every answer came from
```

**Speaker Notes:**
```
"So what's the solution? Meet UnifyData.AI.

[Gesture to screenshot] UnifyData is an enterprise data intelligence
platform that connects every data source in your company into one unified
search. Think of it as Google for your company—but smarter.

Instead of opening Salesforce, then Slack, then your email, then Jira—you
open UnifyData. You type a question in plain English, just like you'd ask
a colleague: 'Which customers mentioned pricing concerns in Q4?'

[Point to results] UnifyData searches across all your connected systems
simultaneously and returns results with complete context. You see
information from your CRM, from Slack conversations, from email threads,
from support tickets—all in one view.

And here's what's critical: [Point to source attribution] Every result
shows you exactly where it came from. Click through to the original source
to verify. No black box AI making stuff up. Complete transparency.

[Point to key benefits] Three things make UnifyData different:

First, we truly unify your data. We're not just a search engine that
indexes documents. We connect structured data (like your CRM) with
unstructured data (like Slack messages) and understand the relationships
between them.

Second, our AI understands intent. Search for 'pricing concerns' and we'll
find 'cost objections,' 'budget issues,' and 'too expensive'—because we
understand meaning, not just keywords.

Third, unlike most enterprise software, we don't charge per user. You pay
for the number of data sources you connect. This means your entire company
can use UnifyData without the cost exploding. Typically 60% cheaper than
per-seat pricing models.

And the best part? No data migration required. We sit on top of your
existing systems. You're live in one day, not months."

**Bottom of Slide: Timeline Graphic**

```
Traditional Approach:
[Day 1] Ask data team → [Day 3] Analyst gathers data → [Day 5] Report delivered → [Day 7] Data already stale

With UnifyData:
[Second 1] Ask UnifyData → [Second 5] Answer delivered → [Seconds later] Click through to verify → Decision made

Time saved: 7 days → 5 seconds (120,000× faster)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
```
"So how does UnifyData actually work? It's incredibly simple—just three
steps.

[Point to Step 1] Step one: Connect your data sources. This takes about 5
minutes per source. You authenticate via OAuth—the same secure login you
use for those apps already. We support 20+ pre-built connectors: Salesforce,
Slack, Gmail, Jira, Notion, Google Drive, and more. And if you need a
connector we don't have, we build custom ones for Enterprise customers.

The key thing here: No data migration. We're not asking you to move your
data into our system. We sit on top of your existing infrastructure. Your
data stays where it is. We just read it and index it for search.

[Point to Step 2] Step two happens automatically: Our AI understands your
data. We build a knowledge graph that maps relationships—this person worked
on that project, which is related to this customer, who mentioned that
product feature. We use semantic search powered by RAG (Retrieval Augmented
Generation—the same technology behind ChatGPT) to understand meaning, not
just keywords. And we learn your company's specific terminology over time.

[Point to Step 3] Step three: You ask questions and get instant answers.
Type a question in plain English, just like you'd ask a colleague. 'Which
deals are at risk this quarter?' or 'What did customers say about our new
feature?' UnifyData searches across all your connected sources
simultaneously and returns comprehensive results in seconds.

[Point to timeline] Let me show you the difference in real terms. The old
way: You ask your data team, they spend 3 days gathering information from
multiple systems, they deliver a report by day 5—and by day 7, the data's
already outdated.

With UnifyData: You ask a question, you get an answer in 5 seconds, you
click through to verify the sources, and you make your decision immediately.

That's the difference between waiting a week and getting an answer in
seconds. 120,000 times faster."

**Speaker Notes:**
```
"Let me quickly walk you through the key features that make UnifyData so
powerful.

[Point to Semantic Search] First, semantic search. This isn't just keyword
matching. Our AI understands meaning. If you search for 'pricing concerns,'
we'll find mentions of 'cost objections,' 'budget issues,' 'too expensive'—
because we understand those are all talking about the same thing. This uses
the same RAG technology behind ChatGPT, but applied to your company's data.

[Point to Knowledge Graph] Second, the knowledge graph. UnifyData doesn't
just return isolated search results. We map relationships across your
entire data ecosystem. This person worked on this deal, which has these
support tickets, which mention these product features. You get complete
context, always.

[Point to Real-Time Sync] Third, real-time sync. What good is data if it's
outdated? On our Professional plan, data syncs every 15 minutes. On
Enterprise, it's instant. The moment a Salesforce deal updates, UnifyData
knows about it.

[Point to Natural Language] Fourth, natural language queries. This is
critical for adoption. Your team doesn't need SQL training. They don't need
to learn a new query language. They just type questions like they'd ask a
colleague: 'Which customers are at risk of churning?' Done.

[Point to Cross-Source] Fifth, cross-source insights. This is where the
magic happens. UnifyData correlates information across all your systems.
Find all Salesforce deals where the customer mentioned a competitor in
Slack and has open critical bugs in Jira. That's intelligence, not just
search.

[Point to Permissions] And sixth, enterprise-grade permissions. Just
because data is unified doesn't mean everyone should see everything. We
respect your existing access controls. Users only see data they're
authorized to access. Source-level and field-level permissions. SOC 2
certified, GDPR compliant.

[Point to bottom banner] Plus all the features you'd expect: Full API,
saved queries with alerts, mobile apps, Slack and Teams integration, audit
logs, and custom connectors.

Everything you need to eliminate data silos—in one platform."

### SLIDE 7: USE CASE - SALES

**Headline:**
```
Close Deals 30% Faster with Complete Account Intelligence
```

**Scenario Description:**
```
Challenge: Sales reps spend 8+ hours per week searching for customer
context across CRM, email, Slack, support tickets, and call recordings
before every prospect call or customer meeting.

Result: Incomplete preparation, missed opportunities, delayed responses.
```

**Example Query (Large, Prominent):**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔍 "Summarize everything about Acme Corp"               │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**UnifyData Returns in 10 Seconds:**

```
📊 SALESFORCE
• 3 open opportunities (€450K total pipeline)
• Stage: 2 in negotiation, 1 in proposal
• Primary contact: Sarah Chen (CTO)
• Last activity: Demo scheduled for next Tuesday

🎫 ZENDESK (Support Tickets)
• 12 total tickets (10 resolved, 2 open)
• 2 critical bugs reported last month (both fixed)
• CSAT score: 4.2/5 (above average)

💬 SLACK
• 45 mentions in #sales channel
• CEO expressed concerns about pricing (3 days ago)
• Product team discussed custom integration needs

📧 GMAIL
• 18 email threads with decision-makers
• Last email: CFO asked about annual contract discounts
• Proposal sent 5 days ago (not opened yet)

📈 PRODUCT USAGE (if integrated)
• Active users: 12 of 15 licenses
• Usage declining 20% over last 30 days ⚠️ (churn signal!)
• Top feature used: Reporting dashboard

🎤 GONG (Call Recordings, if integrated)
• Last call: Competitor (Competitor X) mentioned twice
• Key objection: Implementation timeline (wants faster)
```

**Outcome:**

```
✅ Sales rep enters call fully prepared (2 min prep vs 2 hours)
✅ Addresses pricing concerns proactively
✅ Mentions competitor differentiation
✅ Identifies churn risk (declining usage) and addresses it
✅ Deals close 30% faster, close rate increases 22%

```

**Speaker Notes:**
```
"Let me show you a real-world example of how UnifyData transforms sales.

[Point to challenge] Here's a typical scenario: Your sales rep has a call
with Acme Corp, a key prospect, in 30 minutes. To prepare, they need to:
Open Salesforce to check opportunity status. Open email to find recent
conversations. Search Slack for internal mentions. Check Zendesk for any
support issues. Maybe even listen to the last Gong call recording.

This takes 2 hours. Most reps don't have 2 hours. So they go in
under-prepared, missing critical context.

[Point to query] With UnifyData, the rep types one question: 'Summarize
everything about Acme Corp.'

[Point to results] In 10 seconds, they get a complete 360° view:

From Salesforce: 3 open opportunities worth €450K, 2 in negotiation stage,
primary contact is Sarah Chen their CTO, and there's a demo scheduled for
Tuesday.

From Zendesk: 12 support tickets, mostly resolved, but 2 critical bugs were
reported last month—both fixed. Good news. CSAT score is 4.2, which is
above average.

From Slack: 45 mentions in internal channels. Important: The CEO expressed
concerns about pricing just 3 days ago. The rep now knows to address
pricing proactively.

From email: 18 threads with decision-makers. The CFO recently asked about
annual contract discounts. And the proposal sent 5 days ago? It hasn't been
opened yet. Follow-up needed.

From product usage data: They're using 12 of 15 licenses, but usage is
declining 20% over the last month. That's a churn signal. The rep needs to
dig into why.

From Gong call recordings: The competitor, Competitor X, was mentioned
twice on the last call. And there's a key objection: implementation
timeline—they want faster deployment.

[Point to outcome] Now the rep enters that call fully prepared. They
address pricing concerns before the prospect brings them up. They position
against the competitor. They identify the churn risk from declining usage
and ask about it. They know exactly what to say.

Result: Deals close 30% faster because reps aren't scrambling for
information mid-cycle.

[Point to testimonial] Don't take my word for it. Here's what Mike
Rodriguez, VP of Sales at CloudScale, told us: Their close rate went from
18% to 27%—a 50% improvement—after implementing UnifyData. Why? Because
every rep has complete context on every account, every time."

### SLIDE 8: USE CASE - OPERATIONS

**Headline:**
```
Make Faster, Better Decisions with Complete Operational Intelligence
```

**Scenario Description:**
```
Challenge: COOs and operations leaders need cross-functional insights to
identify bottlenecks, optimize processes, and allocate resources. But data
is fragmented across departments (Sales, Product, Support, Finance).

Result: Decisions made on incomplete data. Bottlenecks discovered too late.
Opportunities missed.
```

**Example Query (Large, Prominent):**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔍 "What's blocking our Q1 growth?"                     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**UnifyData Cross-Functional Analysis in 30 Seconds:**

```
📊 SALES PIPELINE (Salesforce)
• €2.3M pipeline for Q1 (on track)
• BUT: 12 deals stuck in "Negotiation" stage for 30+ days
• Common blocker: Pricing objections (mentioned in 8 deal notes)

🐛 PRODUCT ISSUES (Jira + GitHub)
• 3 critical bugs affecting 15 enterprise customers
• Bug #1234: Data export failing (blocking 3 deals in pipeline)
• Engineering sprint velocity down 20% (capacity issue?)

🎫 CUSTOMER SUPPORT (Zendesk)
• Ticket volume up 35% month-over-month
• Top issue: Feature X not working as expected (47 tickets)
• Average resolution time increased from 2 days → 5 days

👥 TEAM CAPACITY (Slack + HR system)
• Engineering: 2 senior engineers on PTO next month
• Sales: 3 new AEs onboarding (not yet at full productivity)
• Support: Understaffed (handling 40 tickets/person vs target of 25)

💬 INTERNAL DISCUSSIONS (Slack #leadership)
• CEO mentioned competitor launching similar feature next month
• Product team discussing Feature X rewrite (2-month project)
• CFO raised concerns about burn rate in last all-hands

📧 CUSTOMER FEEDBACK (Email + Gong)
• 8 enterprise customers requesting Feature Y (upsell opportunity)
• Net Promoter Score trending down (68 → 62 in last quarter)
```

**Insight Delivered:**

```
🎯 ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED:

1. SALES BOTTLENECK: Pricing objections → Need flexible pricing options
   or better value articulation

2. PRODUCT BOTTLENECK: Bug #1234 blocking deals → Urgent engineering fix
   required (business impact: €450K pipeline at risk)

3. SUPPORT OVERLOAD: Ticket volume spike due to Feature X issues →
   Correlates with Product bug #1234 → Fix bug = reduce tickets

4. CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS: Engineering velocity down + upcoming PTO →
   Will miss Q1 feature deadlines unless priorities shift

5. COMPETITIVE THREAT: Competitor launching similar feature → Need to
   accelerate Feature Y or differentiate

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS (Prioritized):
• Immediate: Escalate Bug #1234 to engineering (blocks €450K pipeline)
• This week: Create flexible pricing options for stuck deals
• This month: Hire 2 support reps (reduce ticket load)
• This quarter: Prioritize Feature Y (8 customers requesting, competitor threat)
```

**Outcome:**

```
✅ Complete operational picture in 30 seconds (vs 2 weeks of gathering data)
✅ Root causes identified (not just symptoms)
✅ Cross-functional dependencies visible (bug affects sales AND support)
✅ Data-driven priorities (not gut feel or HiPPO—Highest Paid Person's Opinion)
✅ Decisions made same day, not next quarterly review
```

**Speaker Notes:**
```
"Now let's talk about operations. This is where UnifyData's cross-source
intelligence really shines.

[Point to challenge] Imagine you're a COO preparing for a quarterly review.
You need to answer: 'What's blocking our Q1 growth?' To answer this, you
need data from sales, product, support, finance, HR—every department.

The old way: You send emails to 5 department heads asking for reports. They
each spend days compiling data. You get spreadsheets back. You spend a week
trying to piece together the story. By the time you present to the board,
the data's already outdated.

[Point to query] With UnifyData, you type one question: 'What's blocking
our Q1 growth?'

[Point to results] In 30 seconds, UnifyData analyzes data across all your
systems and identifies the bottlenecks:

From Sales: Pipeline looks healthy at €2.3M, but 12 deals have been stuck
in negotiation for over 30 days. The blocker? Pricing objections mentioned
in 8 deals.

From Product: There are 3 critical bugs affecting 15 enterprise customers.
One bug—#1234, data export failing—is specifically blocking 3 deals in the
pipeline. And engineering velocity is down 20%. Capacity issue?

From Support: Ticket volume is up 35% month-over-month. The top issue?
Feature X not working—47 tickets. Average resolution time has ballooned
from 2 days to 5 days. Team is overwhelmed.

From HR and Slack: You're about to have a capacity crunch. Two senior
engineers are taking PTO next month. Three new sales AEs are still
onboarding. Support team is understaffed—handling 40 tickets per person
versus a target of 25.

From internal Slack discussions: The CEO mentioned a competitor launching a
similar feature next month. Competitive threat.

[Point to insight] Now here's where it gets powerful. UnifyData doesn't
just give you isolated data points. It connects the dots:

That product bug #1234? It's not just a product issue. It's blocking
€450K in sales pipeline AND causing the support ticket spike. Fix one bug,
solve two problems.

The pricing objections in sales? They correlate with the competitor threat
mentioned by the CEO. You need flexible pricing or better value
articulation.

The engineering velocity drop? Combined with upcoming PTO, you're going to
miss Q1 feature deadlines unless you shift priorities.

[Point to recommended actions] UnifyData prioritizes the actions for you:
Immediate: Fix bug #1234. Business impact: €450K pipeline unblocked.
This week: Create flexible pricing tiers for stuck deals.
This month: Hire 2 support reps.
This quarter: Prioritize Feature Y that 8 customers are requesting.

[Point to outcome] This is the difference between reactive management and
proactive leadership. Instead of discovering problems during the quarterly
review, you identify and solve them in real-time.

[Point to testimonial] Lisa Tran, COO at DataFlow, told us: 'I used to
spend 2 weeks preparing for quarterly reviews. Now I have real-time
operational intelligence every single day.'

That's the power of unified data. Not just search. Intelligence."

with incomplete, outdated, or conflicting information. By the time reports
are compiled, the moment has passed.

Result: Decisions made on gut feel instead of data. Strategic opportunities
missed. Board meetings with stale insights.
```

**Example Query (Large, Prominent):**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔍 "Are we on track to hit our Q1 revenue target?"      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

• Market sentiment: Positive on our space (3 competitors raised funding)

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🎯 WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO HIT TARGET:

1. ACCELERATE TOP 3 DEALS (€600K)
   • Acme Corp (€300K) - needs executive engagement (CEO call)
   • Beta Inc (€200K) - waiting on legal (expedite contract)
   • Gamma Ltd (€100K) - pricing objection (offer discount)

2. PREVENT CHURN (€200K at risk)
   • Customer A: Critical bug affecting them (escalate to eng)
   • Customer B: Low usage (CSM intervention needed)
   • Customer C, D: Renewal coming up (proactive outreach)

3. CLOSE EXPANSION DEALS (€150K opportunity)
   • 8 customers ready to upgrade (Sales should reach out)

4. REDUCE SALES CYCLE (47 days → 38 days target)
   • Bottleneck identified: Contract negotiation phase
   • Solution: Pre-approved contract templates

5. DIFFERENTIATE AGAINST COMPETITOR X
   • They launched Feature Y (we don't have it yet)
   • Alternative: Emphasize our superior integration depth

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📊 REVISED FORECAST:

PESSIMISTIC (if no action): €4.7M ARR (€300K short)
REALISTIC (with above actions): €4.95M ARR (€50K short, 99% of target)
OPTIMISTIC (all deals close): €5.2M ARR (104% of target)

RECOMMENDATION: Execute actions 1-3 immediately (high impact, low effort)
```

**Outcome:**

```
✅ Complete business intelligence in 15 seconds (not 2-week board prep)
✅ Specific actions to hit target (not vague "work harder")
✅ Risk factors identified proactively (prevent surprises)
✅ Cross-functional dependencies visible (sales + CS + product)
✅ Executive can lead with data, not gut feel

**Speaker Notes:**
```
"Let me show you how UnifyData transforms executive decision-making.

[Point to challenge] Imagine you're a CEO 6 weeks before end of quarter.
Your board asks: 'Are we on track to hit our revenue target?' You need a
complete picture: Sales pipeline, customer health, competitive landscape,
operational capacity, market conditions.

The old way: You ask your VPs for reports. They spend a week compiling
data. You get conflicting numbers. Sales says 'we're on track.' Customer
Success says 'we have churn risk.' By the time you have clarity, 2 weeks
have passed.

[Point to query] With UnifyData, you type one question: 'Are we on track to
hit our Q1 revenue target?'

[Point to overall status] In 15 seconds, you get an executive summary:
Status is 'At Risk' with 78% confidence to hit target. You're at €3.8M ARR,
need €1.2M more in 6 weeks. That's a €200K/week run rate required, but
historically you close €180K/week. You're 10% below pace.

[Point to sales pipeline] The pipeline looks decent—€2.3M in late-stage
deals. But at a 45% close rate, that's only €1.04M projected closed. You're
€160K short. And the top 3 deals, worth €600K combined, might push to Q2.

[Point to leading indicators] Some good news: Demo volume is up 25%, win
rate improved to 28%. But sales cycle has lengthened to 47 days, and
average deal size is down 12%. Mixed signals.

[Point to customer success] There's €200K ARR at churn risk—4 customers
identified. But there's also €150K in expansion opportunities from 8
customers ready to upgrade. Net impact: -€50K if you don't intervene.

[Point to competitive] Competitor X is showing up more in lost deals—18% vs
12% last quarter. They launched a new feature 2 weeks ago that you don't
have. Threat.

[Point to operations] Capacity concerns: 3 new sales AEs still ramping. A
critical product feature is delayed 2 weeks. Support has a 30% ticket
backlog.

[Scroll down to actions] But here's what makes UnifyData invaluable—it
doesn't just give you the data. It tells you what to DO.

To hit your target, you need to:
1. Accelerate the top 3 deals—€600K. Acme Corp needs a CEO call. Beta Inc
is stuck in legal—expedite it. Gamma Ltd has a pricing objection—offer a
discount.

2. Prevent that €200K churn. Customer A has a critical bug affecting
them—escalate to engineering. Customer B has low usage—get your CSM on it.

3. Close those €150K expansion opportunities. 8 customers are ready to
upgrade—sales just needs to ask.

4. Reduce your sales cycle from 47 days back to 38. The bottleneck is
contract negotiation—create pre-approved templates.

5. Differentiate against Competitor X. They have Feature Y, you don't. But
you have superior integration depth—lead with that.

[Point to forecast] With these actions, UnifyData updates your forecast:
Pessimistic scenario: €4.7M (€300K short). Realistic scenario: €4.95M (€50K
short—99% of target). Optimistic: €5.2M (104% of target).

[Point to outcome] The difference? Instead of discovering you're off track
at the board meeting, you know today. You have 6 weeks to execute specific,
high-impact actions.

[Point to testimonial] James Chen, CEO of ScaleUp Inc, said it best:
'Before UnifyData, I was flying blind between quarterly reviews. Now I have
complete business intelligence at my fingertips. I make decisions in hours,
not weeks.'

This is executive intelligence. Not dashboards. Not reports. Answers."

"One of the most common questions we get is: 'Does UnifyData integrate with
[specific tool]?' The answer is almost always yes.

[Gesture to grid] We have 20+ pre-built connectors for the most popular
enterprise tools. Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive for CRM. Slack, Teams,
Gmail, Outlook for communication. Jira, Asana, Monday for project
management. Notion, Confluence, Google Drive for documentation. Zendesk,
Intercom for support. GitHub, GitLab for code and engineering data.

[Point to each row] These are OAuth integrations—secure, one-click setup.
No need to share passwords or API keys manually. You authenticate the same
way you log into these tools already. Takes about 5 minutes per source.

[Point to custom connectors] Don't see your tool here? We build custom
connectors for Enterprise customers. Maybe you're using SAP or Oracle or a
legacy database. Maybe you have a proprietary internal system. Maybe
there's an industry-specific tool unique to your space.

We build those connectors for you. Typically delivered in 2-4 weeks. On our
Professional plan, you get 2 custom connectors included. On Enterprise,
it's unlimited.

[Point to features] And these aren't basic integrations. We support
real-time sync on Enterprise—the moment data changes in the source system,
UnifyData knows about it. We do incremental updates, so we're only syncing
changes, not re-indexing everything every time. And we support webhooks for
instant updates.

The key thing: No data migration required. We sit on top of your existing
infrastructure. Your data stays where it is. We just read it, index it, and
make it searchable.

So whether you're using the most popular tools or the most obscure
ones—UnifyData connects to it."

```

**Speaker Notes:**
```
"I know security is top of mind for every enterprise buyer. When you're
unifying data, security isn't optional—it's everything. Let me walk you
through how we keep your data secure.

[Point to Certifications] First, certifications. We're SOC 2 Type II
certified, audited annually by an independent third party. We're ISO 27001
compliant. We're GDPR compliant with EU data residency options—your data
never leaves the EU if you're an EU customer. We're HIPAA-ready with BAA
(Business Associate Agreements) for healthcare customers. And we're PCI DSS
Level 1 certified for financial data.

These aren't just checkboxes. These are rigorous security frameworks that
we're audited against every year.

[Point to Encryption] Second, encryption. All data is encrypted at rest
using AES-256—military-grade encryption. All data in transit uses TLS 1.3.
On our Enterprise plan, you can even bring your own encryption keys—
customer-managed keys. And your data never leaves your chosen region. If
you're in the EU, your data stays in the EU. No cross-border transfers, no
GDPR concerns.

[Point to Access Control] Third, access control. Just because data is
unified doesn't mean everyone should see everything. We have role-based
permissions: Admin, Member, Viewer, and custom roles. We have source-level
permissions—your Finance team can't see HR data. We have field-level
permissions—hide sensitive fields like salary. We integrate with your
existing SSO (SAML 2.0, OAuth, LDAP). And we require multi-factor
authentication for admin users.

[Point to Audit Logs] Fourth, audit and monitoring. We log everything. Who
accessed what data, when, from where. Logs are retained for 1 year (longer
if you need it for compliance). We have real-time anomaly detection—if
someone accesses data in an unusual pattern, we flag it. We do annual
penetration testing, plus on-demand testing for Enterprise customers. And
we offer quarterly security reviews.

[Point to bottom banner] But here's what's most important: Your data stays
yours. We never train AI models on your data—unlike some consumer AI tools.
We never sell your data. We never share it with third parties. We're a
processor, not an owner. You can export or delete your data anytime.

And for customers with the strictest requirements—government, healthcare,
finance—we offer private cloud deployment (your own VPC) and even
on-premise deployment for air-gapped environments.

[Point to documents] All our security documentation is available: SOC 2
report, security whitepaper, DPA for GDPR, and full compliance docs.

Security isn't an afterthought at UnifyData. It's built into everything we
do."

"Don't just take my word for it. Let me show you what our customers are
saying.

[Point to metrics bar] These are real numbers from our customer base. We've
helped our customers save over 500,000 hours every single month. That's
productivity reclaimed. We've eliminated 70% of ad-hoc data requests—
freeing up data teams to do strategic work instead of being report
factories. We've delivered over €15 million in documented cost savings. And
we have a 4.8-star rating on G2 from real users.

[Point to logos if available] We're trusted by innovative companies across
industries—B2B SaaS, FinTech, HealthTech, E-commerce, Professional
Services. From 50-person scale-ups to 1,000+ person enterprises.

[Point to testimonials] But let me show you specific stories.

[Point to first testimonial] Alex Turner, CTO at CloudVentures, a
150-person B2B SaaS company: 'Setup took 30 minutes. ROI was immediate. Our
team saved 40 hours per week in the first month.' That's 160 hours per
month. At €50/hour, that's €8,000 saved monthly on a €799 subscription. 10×
ROI.

[Point to second testimonial] Maria Santos, VP of Operations at DataCorp:
'We tried Glean and Guru'—our competitors—'UnifyData is 1/3 the cost and
does 10× more.' She specifically called out that we're true data
unification, not just document search. That's the key differentiator.

[Point to third testimonial] And James Chen, CEO at ScaleUp Inc: 'Our sales
close rate went from 18% to 27%'—that's a 50% improvement. 'Our data team's
ad-hoc requests dropped 70%. UnifyData paid for itself in the first month.'

These aren't cherry-picked testimonials. These are typical results.

[Point to ratings] And you can verify this independently. We have 4.8 stars
on G2 with 42 reviews. 4.9 stars on Capterra with 38 reviews. We were #3
Product of the Day on Product Hunt on our launch day.

[Point to bottom CTA] We have dozens more customer stories on our website.
But I think the numbers speak for themselves: 500+ companies, 4.8-star
ratings, documented ROI from day one.

When was the last time you bought software that actually delivered on its
promises? That's UnifyData."

**Speaker Notes:**

"Let's talk about pricing. We've designed our pricing to be simple,
transparent, and aligned with how you actually scale.

[Point to three cards] We have three plans: Starter, Professional, and
Enterprise.

[Point to Starter] Starter is €249 per month, perfect for startups and
small teams—10 to 50 employees. You get 5 data sources, 10 users, 50 GB of
storage, and email support. All the core features are included. This is
ideal if you're just getting started with data unification.

[Point to Professional] Professional—our most popular plan—is €799 per
month. This is designed for scale-ups, 50 to 250 employees. You get 20 data
sources, 50 users included, 250 GB of storage, priority support with
12-hour response time, 2 custom connectors, and real-time sync every 15
minutes. Most of our customers start here.

[Point to Enterprise] Enterprise is €2,499 per month, designed for large
organizations—250+ employees. You get unlimited data sources, unlimited
users, 1 terabyte or more of storage, 24/7 priority support with 2-hour
SLA, unlimited custom connectors, instant real-time sync, a dedicated
account manager, and all the enterprise features: SOC 2, SSO, white-label
options.

[Point to value callout] Now, here's what makes our pricing different—and
better for you.

Most enterprise software charges per user. Let's say you're a 100-person
company looking at a competitor like Glean. They charge €20 per user per
month. That's 100 users times €20—€2,000 per month, €24,000 per year.

With UnifyData Professional, you pay €799 per month—50 users are already
included. You save 60%. And if you want to add more users? On Professional,
it's just €15 per user (vs €20 for competitors). On Enterprise, it's
unlimited—no per-seat cost at all.

Why does this matter? Because per-seat pricing penalizes you for doing what
you should be doing—making your entire company data-driven. With per-seat
pricing, every new hire is a budget conversation. With UnifyData, you can
onboard your entire company without worrying about the cost exploding.

You pay for the value you're getting—access to your data sources—not for
how many people benefit from it.

[Point to trust signals] And to make this easy: 14-day free trial on all
plans. No credit card required to start. Cancel anytime if it's not working
for you. We're confident you'll see value immediately, so we make it risk-
free.

[Point to link] Full pricing details, including add-ons and a complete
feature comparison, are on our website. But those are the basics: €249,
€799, or €2,499—depending on your company size and needs.

Most companies start with Professional and upgrade to Enterprise as they
scale. That's the natural path."

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Speaker Notes:**
```
"So why choose UnifyData over the alternatives? Let me give you 5 compelling
reasons.

[Point to Reason 1] First, fastest time to value. You're live in one day,
not six months. Connect 5 data sources in 30 minutes via OAuth—no IT team
required. No data migration. No complex setup. No expensive professional
services. You start getting value from day one.

Compare that to competitors who require 3-6 month implementations, or
building in-house which takes 9-18 months. One day vs six months. That's
the difference.

[Point to Reason 2] Second, we're true data unification, not just search.
Most 'enterprise search' tools just index documents—think Google for your
files. That's not enough. UnifyData builds a knowledge graph that maps
relationships across all your data. We use semantic search powered by RAG
to understand meaning, not just keywords. We deliver cross-source
insights—connecting dots across systems, not just finding isolated pieces.

This is intelligence, not search.

[Point to Reason 3] Third, no per-seat pricing. We charge per data source,
not per user. For a 100-person company, a competitor like Glean charges
€2,000 per month. UnifyData Professional is €799 per month. You save 60%.

And more importantly, you can roll this out company-wide without worrying
about the budget exploding every time you hire someone. Per-seat pricing is
a collaboration tax. We don't charge you for doing the right thing—making
your whole company data-driven.

[Point to Reason 4] Fourth, we're built on the latest AI technology. RAG
(Retrieval Augmented Generation), the same tech behind ChatGPT. Vector
embeddings for semantic understanding. Natural language queries—no SQL, no
training required. And we continuously improve as AI models advance.

Many competitors are built on 5-year-old search technology. We're built on
2024 AI. That's a generational difference.

[Point to Reason 5] And fifth, dedicated support and success. You're not
just buying software—you're getting a partner. Dedicated onboarding
specialist who spends 4 hours getting you set up. Priority support: 12-hour
response on Professional, 2-hour on Enterprise. Quarterly business reviews.
Direct access to our product team for feature requests. And we build custom
connectors for you.

Most enterprise software companies make you submit a ticket and hope. We
provide white-glove service because we want to ensure your success.

[Point to comparison table] Let me show you this visually. Time to deploy:
UnifyData is 1 day. Glean is 3 months. Building in-house is 9-18 months.

Cost for 100 users: UnifyData is €799/month. Glean is €2,000/month.
Building in-house is €500,000+ upfront plus ongoing maintenance.

We have 20+ connectors with more coming monthly. We offer semantic search
and custom connectors included. And we handle all the maintenance—you don't
have to.

[Point to conclusion] The best choice is clear: Fast, affordable,
comprehensive. That's UnifyData."

"We've covered a lot in the last 15 minutes. Let me summarize where we are

ROI.

And you've seen the pricing: €249 for Starter, €799 for Professional,
€2,499 for Enterprise. 60% cheaper than per-seat alternatives.

### POST-PRODUCTION NOTES

**Captions/Subtitles:**
- Add subtitles throughout (accessibility + many viewers watch muted)
- Use clean sans-serif font (Inter from brand guidelines)
- White text with black outline for readability

**Sound Design:**
- Voiceover: Professional, clear enunciation, friendly but authoritative
- Music: Subtle, doesn't overpower narration
- Sound effects: Minimal (click sounds for UI interactions, "whoosh" for
  transitions)

**Color Grading:**
- Consistent brand colors throughout
- Product UI should be bright and clean
- Problem scenes slightly desaturated (to contrast with solution)

**Video Export:**
- Resolution: 1080p minimum (4K if budget allows)
- Format: MP4 (H.264 codec for web compatibility)
- Length: Keep under 5 minutes (4:05 is ideal)
- File size: Optimize for web (<50MB if possible)

**Distribution:**
- YouTube (primary)
- Vimeo (for website embed)
- LinkedIn (native upload for better reach)
- Website homepage (above the fold)
- Sales deck (embedded or linked)
