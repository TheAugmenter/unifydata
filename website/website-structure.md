### Section 2: Problem Statement

**Background:** Light gray background, full-width

**Headline (H2):**
```
Your Data is Everywhere. Your Team Shouldn't Have to Be.
```

**Subheadline:**
```
Scale-ups and enterprises use 20-50+ tools. Every question requires
searching across 10 different systems. It's slow, frustrating, and
costs your company millions.
```

│  A 500-person company wastes 2,500 hours/month searching.   │
│  At €50/hour, that's €1.5M per year lost to data silos.     │

**Headline:**
```
Close Deals 40% Faster with Complete Account Intelligence

**Description:**
```
Sales reps spend 8+ hours per week searching for customer context
across CRM, email, Slack, support tickets, and call recordings.
UnifyData gives them everything in one search—so they can focus on
selling, not searching.
```

**Example Query (with screenshot mockup description):**
```
Query: "Summarize everything about Acme Corp"

Results show:
• 3 open opportunities (€450K total pipeline)
• 12 support tickets (2 critical, 10 resolved)
• 45 Slack mentions (including CEO discussing pricing)
• 8 email threads with decision-makers
• Product usage data (declined 20% last month—churn risk!)

Sales rep now has complete context in 10 seconds (vs 2 hours).
```

**Customer Testimonial:**
```
"Our sales close rate went from 18% to 27% after implementing UnifyData.

Prevent Churn with Proactive, Data-Driven Customer Success

every conversation. UnifyData unifies it all, so you can prevent
churn before it happens.
```

**Example Query:**
```
Query: "Which enterprise customers are at risk of churning?"

  product usage down 40%, renewal in 45 days

  in 21 days, contract value €500K
• Delta Ltd: Mentioned competitor in 3 Slack threads, support
  satisfaction low

CS team intervenes immediately, prevents €1.2M in churn.

#### **Tab 3: For Data Teams**

**Icon:** 📊

**Headline:**
```
Scale Data Access Without Scaling Your Team
```

**Description:**
```
Data teams are bottlenecks. Every stakeholder needs a report, a
dashboard, an answer. UnifyData democratizes data access—business
users self-serve with natural language, freeing your team for
strategic work.
```

**Example Query:**
```
Query: "Show me Q4 sales performance by region and product"

Instead of:
❌ Stakeholder emails data team
❌ Data analyst spends 3 days building report
❌ Report delivered (data already outdated)

Now:
✅ Stakeholder asks UnifyData
✅ Answer in 5 seconds (pulled from Salesforce + analytics DB)
✅ Data team focuses on strategic analytics, not ad-hoc requests

Result: Data team ad-hoc requests reduced by 70%.
```

**Customer Testimonial:**

"Our data team went from firefighting mode to strategic mode.
UnifyData handled 70% of ad-hoc requests automatically."

complete picture—sales, operations, customer health, product,
finance—in one question. No more waiting on reports or asking your
team to "pull some data."
```

**Example Query:**
```
Query: "What's blocking our Q1 growth?"

UnifyData analyzes:
• Sales pipeline (stuck deals: pricing objections in 12 opportunities)
• Support tickets (3 critical bugs affecting 15 enterprise customers)

• Team capacity (Engineering sprint velocity down 20%)

Insight delivered in 30 seconds. Executive team pivots strategy
same day (vs waiting 2 weeks for quarterly review).
```

### Section 2: Core Capabilities (10 Features)

**Background:** Alternating white/light gray for each feature

---

#### **Capability 1: Natural Language Search**

**Headline:**
```
Ask Questions Like a Human, Not a Database
```

**Description:**
```
Forget SQL. Forget complex queries. Forget training sessions. UnifyData
understands natural language—ask questions the way you'd ask a colleague.

"Which customers mentioned pricing in the last 30 days?"
"Show me all bugs affecting enterprise accounts."
"Summarize Q4 performance by region."

UnifyData parses your question, understands intent, searches across all
connected sources, and returns comprehensive answers—with complete source
attribution so you can verify every fact.

This isn't just keyword matching. Our semantic search powered by RAG
(Retrieval Augmented Generation) understands meaning, synonyms, and
context. Search for "pricing concerns" and we'll find "cost objections,"
"budget issues," and "price sensitivity" too.
```

**Use Case Example:**
```
Sales Manager asks: "Which deals closed in Q4 and why?"

UnifyData searches:
• Salesforce: Closed-won opportunities, deal values, close dates
• Gong: Call recordings with close reasons
• Slack: #sales channel discussions about closed deals
• Email: Final contract negotiations

Result: Comprehensive report showing 47 closed deals (€2.3M total), with
top 3 close reasons extracted from calls and conversations:
1. Strong product-market fit (mentioned in 18 deals)
2. Competitive pricing (mentioned in 14 deals)
3. Implementation timeline (mentioned in 12 deals)

Time: 5 seconds (vs 3 days for data team to compile manually)
```

**Screenshot Description:**
```
Screenshot shows:
• Search bar with query: "Which deals closed in Q4 and why?"
• Results panel showing:
  - Summary card: "47 deals closed, €2.3M total"
  - Top reasons with quotes from sources
  - Individual deal cards with source icons (Salesforce, Gong, Slack)
  - "View full report" button
```

#### **Capability 2: Unified Data Access**

**Headline:**
```
One Search, Every Data Source
```

**Description:**
```
Your company's data lives in 20-50+ tools: Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack,
Microsoft Teams, Gmail, Outlook, Google Drive, Notion, Confluence, Jira,
GitHub, Zendesk, Intercom, QuickBooks, and more.

UnifyData connects them all. One search interface, every data source.

Our pre-built connectors integrate in minutes via OAuth—no complex setup,
no data migration, no engineering team required. We sync your data in
real-time (Enterprise) or every 15 minutes (Professional), so your search
results are always current.

Need a connector we don't have yet? We build custom connectors for
Enterprise customers—usually delivered in 2-4 weeks.
```

**Use Case Example:**
```
Customer Success Manager needs complete customer context for renewal call.

Instead of:
❌ Open Salesforce (check account details, contract value, history)
❌ Open Zendesk (check support tickets, satisfaction scores)
❌ Open product analytics (check usage data, feature adoption)
❌ Search Slack (find mentions of customer in #customer-success)
❌ Search email (find communications with decision-makers)
❌ Check Google Drive (find QBR deck, proposals, agreements)

Total time: 45 minutes, incomplete information (missed 2 sources)

With UnifyData:
✅ Ask: "Summarize Acme Corp account"
✅ Get: Complete 360° view in 10 seconds
   - Salesforce: €500K contract, renews in 30 days
   - Zendesk: 8 open tickets (2 critical), CSAT 4.2/5
   - Product: Usage down 30% (churn signal!)
   - Slack: CEO mentioned competitor in thread last week
   - Email: CFO asked about pricing flexibility
   - Drive: Last QBR showed concerns about ROI

CS Manager now has complete context. Identifies churn risk. Escalates to
exec team. Prevents €500K churn.
```

**Screenshot Description:**
```
Screenshot shows:
• Unified search bar at top
• Below: Grid of 20+ connected data source logos
• Checkmarks on connected sources (green)
• "Add data source" button for new connections

#### **Capability 3: Knowledge Graph Intelligence**

**Headline:**
```
See How Everything Connects
```

**Description:**
```
Data isn't isolated—it's interconnected. That Salesforce deal is connected
to support tickets, which are connected to product bugs, which are
connected to engineering Jira issues, which are connected to Slack
conversations between teams.

UnifyData's knowledge graph automatically maps these relationships. We
extract entities (people, companies, products, deals, tickets, documents)
and understand how they relate to each other.

This means you don't just get search results—you get intelligent insights
that connect dots across your entire business.
```

**Use Case Example:**
```
VP of Product asks: "Why is Acme Corp considering churn?"

Traditional search: Returns isolated results from different tools

UnifyData's knowledge graph:
1. Identifies Acme Corp entity
2. Maps all related entities:
   - 3 Salesforce opportunities (€500K ARR)
   - 12 support tickets (2 critical bugs)
   - Product usage data (down 30% in 60 days)
   - 8 Slack mentions (concerns about feature X)
   - 4 Jira issues (bugs affecting Acme Corp)
   - 6 email threads (CFO asking about alternatives)
3. Identifies relationships:
   - Critical bug #1234 is blocking Feature X
   - Feature X was mentioned in 3 support tickets from Acme
   - Acme's usage dropped immediately after bug appeared
   - Competitor mentioned in Slack has Feature X working

Insight: "Acme Corp is at risk because bug #1234 blocks Feature X, which
they rely on. Competitor has this working. Fix bug = save customer."

VP escalates to engineering. Bug fixed in 48 hours. Customer retained.
```

**Visual Description:**
```
Interactive knowledge graph visualization:
• Center node: "Acme Corp"
• Connected nodes:
  - Deals (orange circles)
  - Tickets (red circles)
  - People (blue circles)
  - Bugs (red triangles)
  - Features (green squares)
• Lines show relationships
• Hovering shows details
• Clicking navigates to source
```

#### **Capability 4: Semantic Search & RAG**

**Headline:**
```
AI-Powered Search That Understands Meaning
```

**Description:**
```
Keyword search is dumb. It looks for exact matches. If you search for
"pricing objection," it misses "cost concern," "budget issue," and "too
expensive."

UnifyData's semantic search understands meaning, not just words. Powered
by RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and vector embeddings, we map
your query to semantically similar content—even if the exact words don't
match.

This is the same technology behind ChatGPT, but applied to your company's
private data. The result? You find what you're looking for, even if you
don't know the exact keywords.
```

**Technical Deep-Dive:**
```
How it works:
1. Data Ingestion: We ingest and chunk your content (documents, messages,
   tickets, etc.)
2. Embedding Generation: Each chunk is converted to a vector embedding
   (numerical representation of meaning)
3. Vector Storage: Embeddings stored in vector database (optimized for
   similarity search)
4. Query Processing: Your natural language query is also converted to
   embedding
5. Similarity Search: We find content with similar embeddings (similar
   meaning)
6. Context Retrieval: Top relevant chunks retrieved
7. LLM Generation: Results augmented with LLM for comprehension and
   summarization
8. Source Attribution: Every fact linked back to original source

Result: Intelligent search that understands intent and context.
```

**Comparison Table:**

| Feature | Keyword Search | Semantic Search (UnifyData) |
|---------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Matching** | Exact word match | Meaning-based match |
| **Example** | Search "pricing objection" only finds those exact words | Finds "pricing objection," "cost concern," "budget issue," "too expensive" |
| **Synonyms** | No | Yes |
| **Context** | No | Yes (understands relationships) |
| **Questions** | Struggles with natural language | Designed for natural language |
| **Accuracy** | 60-70% | 85-95% |

---

#### **Capability 5: Real-Time Data Sync**

**Headline:**
```
Always Current, Never Stale
```

**Description:**
```
What good is data if it's outdated? UnifyData syncs in real-time
(Enterprise plan) or every 15 minutes (Professional plan).

When a Salesforce deal updates, a Slack message is sent, or a support
ticket is resolved—UnifyData knows immediately. Your search results
reflect the current state of your business, not yesterday's snapshot.

We use incremental sync (only changes, not full reindex) to keep data
fresh without consuming excessive resources. Webhooks and event-driven
architecture ensure minimal latency.
```

**Use Case Example:**
```
Sales rep on a call with a prospect. Prospect asks: "Has this bug been
fixed yet?"

Sales rep searches UnifyData: "Status of bug #1234"

Result: "Bug #1234 was marked as resolved 2 hours ago by Engineering.
Fix deployed to production."

Sales rep confidently tells prospect: "Yes, fixed this morning."

If data was stale (synced daily): Sales rep would say "Let me check and
get back to you" → loses momentum → deal delays.

Real-time data = real-time confidence.
```

---

#### **Capability 6: Enterprise-Grade Security**

**Headline:**
```
Your Data. Your Control. Fully Secure.
```

**Description:**
```
When you unify data, security is paramount. UnifyData is built
enterprise-grade from day one.

**Certifications & Compliance:**
• SOC 2 Type II certified (annually audited)
• GDPR compliant (data residency options: EU, US)
• HIPAA available (BAA provided for healthcare customers)
• ISO 27001 certified
• PCI DSS Level 1 (for financial data)

**Encryption:**
• Data encrypted at rest (AES-256)
• Data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
• Customer-managed encryption keys (Enterprise plan)

**Access Control:**
• Role-based permissions (Admin, Member, Viewer, Custom roles)
• Source-level access control (Finance team can't see HR data)
• Field-level permissions (hide sensitive fields like salary)
• SSO integration (SAML 2.0, OAuth, LDAP)
• Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for admins

**Audit & Monitoring:**
• Complete audit logs (who accessed what, when, from where)
• 1-year log retention (longer available)
• Real-time anomaly detection (unusual access patterns)
• Quarterly security reviews (Enterprise plan)

**Data Residency:**
• Your data never leaves your chosen region (EU or US)
• No cross-border data transfer (GDPR requirement)
• Private cloud deployment available (VPC)
• On-premise deployment available (air-gapped environments)

Your data stays yours. We never train AI models on your data. We never
sell your data. Your data is yours, period.
```

**Security Architecture Diagram Description:**
```
Diagram shows:
• Data sources (left) → Encrypted connections (TLS) → UnifyData (center)
• UnifyData layers:
  - API layer (authentication, rate limiting)
  - Permission layer (RBAC, access control)
  - Processing layer (encrypted at rest)
  - Vector DB (encrypted storage)
• Audit logs (bottom) track all access
• Admin dashboard (top right) monitors security
```

#### **Capability 7: Complete Data Lineage**

**Headline:**
```
Trust, But Verify: See Exactly Where Data Came From
```

**Description:**
```
In the era of AI hallucinations, trust matters. UnifyData shows you
exactly where every piece of information came from.

Every search result includes:
• Source attribution (which system: Salesforce, Slack, etc.)
• Document/record ID (e.g., "Salesforce Opportunity #12345")
• Timestamp (when this data was created/updated)
• Author (who created it)
• Link to original source (click through to verify)

No black boxes. No "trust the AI." Complete transparency.
```

**Use Case Example:**
```
CFO asks: "What was our Q4 revenue?"

UnifyData returns: "Q4 revenue was €2.3M"

Sources shown:
📊 Salesforce: €2.1M (closed-won opportunities, Oct 1 - Dec 31)
💳 Stripe: €2.3M (actual payments received)
📧 Finance email: €2.25M (reported in CFO's Q4 summary email on Jan 5)

CFO sees slight discrepancy (Salesforce vs Stripe). Investigates.
Discovers €200K deal closed but not yet invoiced in Salesforce.

Without data lineage: CFO trusts wrong number → misinforms board →
credibility issue

With data lineage: CFO catches discrepancy → corrects data → accurate
reporting
```

**Screenshot Description:**
```
Screenshot shows search result with data lineage panel:
• Main answer at top: "Q4 revenue was €2.3M"
• Below: "Sources" section with 3 expandable cards
  - Card 1: Salesforce icon + "€2.1M" + "View in Salesforce" link
  - Card 2: Stripe icon + "€2.3M" + "View in Stripe" link
  - Card 3: Gmail icon + "€2.25M (reported by CFO)" + "View email" link
• Each card shows timestamp and author
```

• Sandbox environment (test without affecting production)

**Use Cases:**
• Embed UnifyData search in your own app
• Build custom workflows (Zapier, Make.com integrations)
• Automate data pipelines (ingest, process, alert)
• Create custom dashboards (pull data via API, visualize in BI tool)
```

**Code Example:**
```python
from unifydata import UnifyDataClient

client = UnifyDataClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Run a search query
results = client.search(
    query="Which customers mentioned pricing in Q4?",
    sources=["salesforce", "slack", "gmail"],
    date_range={"start": "2024-10-01", "end": "2024-12-31"}
)

# Process results
for result in results:
    print(f"Customer: {result.customer_name}")
    print(f"Source: {result.source}")
    print(f"Excerpt: {result.excerpt}")
    print(f"Link: {result.source_url}")
```

#### **Capability 9: Cross-Source Intelligence**

**Headline:**
```
Connect the Dots Across Your Entire Business
```

**Description:**
```
Most tools search within one system. UnifyData searches across all
systems and connects insights.

Sales data in Salesforce. Support data in Zendesk. Product data in Jira.
Conversations in Slack. Emails in Gmail. Documents in Google Drive.

UnifyData correlates these sources to give you complete context.
```

**Use Case Example:**
```
Product Manager asks: "What features are enterprise customers requesting?"

UnifyData searches:
• Salesforce: Feature requests logged in opportunities (CRM field)
• Zendesk: Feature requests mentioned in support tickets
• Productboard: Feature votes from customers
• Slack: #customer-feedback channel mentions
• Gong: Call recordings where customers mentioned "wish list"
• Intercom: In-app feedback widget submissions

Results: Top 5 requested features with frequency:
1. Advanced API rate limits (mentioned 23 times across 6 sources)
2. SSO with Okta (mentioned 18 times)
3. Real-time webhooks (mentioned 15 times)
4. Custom reporting (mentioned 12 times)
5. Mobile app (mentioned 10 times)

PM prioritizes roadmap based on complete data, not gut feel.
```

#### **Capability 10: Saved Queries & Alerts**

**Headline:**
```
Ask Once, Get Notified Forever
```

**Description:**
```
Some questions you need answered regularly:
• "Which deals are at risk this week?"
• "Any critical bugs reported today?"
• "New enterprise leads to follow up on?"

Don't re-run the same query every day. Save it. Set up alerts.

UnifyData will automatically run saved queries on a schedule (daily,
weekly, monthly) and notify you (email, Slack, webhook) when there are
new results or significant changes.
```

**Use Case Example:**
```
Sales Manager creates saved query: "Deals over €100K closing in next 30
days with high risk"

UnifyData runs this query every morning at 8 AM.

Alert sent to Slack #sales-leadership channel:
"🚨 3 high-risk deals identified:
• Acme Corp (€500K) - 8 open critical tickets, usage down 40%
• Beta Inc (€300K) - Champion left company, no contact in 14 days
• Gamma Ltd (€150K) - Mentioned competitor in Slack thread yesterday

[View details] →"

Sales Manager takes immediate action. Prevents €950K in lost pipeline.

Without alerts: Manager manually checks dashboard daily (often forgets) →
discovers issues too late → loses deals
```

### FAQ Section

**Headline:**
```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

---

**Q1: Can I change plans?**
```
Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade anytime. Upgrades take effect
immediately. Downgrades take effect at your next billing cycle. If you
upgrade mid-month, we'll prorate the difference.
```

---

**Q2: What happens after my trial ends?**
```
Your 14-day free trial gives you full access to Professional plan
features. No credit card required to start. At the end of the trial,
you'll be prompted to choose a paid plan (Starter, Professional, or
Enterprise). If you don't choose, your account will be paused (data
preserved for 30 days). You can reactivate anytime within 30 days.
```

---

**Q3: Do you offer refunds?**
```
Yes. We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for first-time customers. If
you're not satisfied, email us within 30 days of your first payment and
we'll refund you in full—no questions asked. For annual plans, we refund
the unused portion if you cancel after 30 days.
```

---

**Q4: What payment methods do you accept?**
```
We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex), ACH transfer,
wire transfer (for annual plans >€10K), and invoicing (Enterprise only).
All payments processed securely via Stripe.
```

---

**Q5: How does per-data-source pricing work?**
```
You pay based on the number of data sources you connect (Salesforce,
Slack, Gmail, etc.)—not the number of users. This means your entire
company can use UnifyData without increasing costs. As you add more data
sources, you may need to upgrade to a higher tier (Starter: 5 sources,
Professional: 20 sources, Enterprise: unlimited).
```

---

**Q6: What counts as a "data source"?**
```
Each distinct system counts as one data source. Examples:
• Salesforce = 1 source
• Slack = 1 source (all workspaces)
• Gmail = 1 source (all inboxes)
• Google Drive = 1 source
• Notion = 1 source

If you have multiple instances of the same tool (e.g., 2 Salesforce
orgs), each counts as a separate source.
```

---

**Q7: Can I add more users than my plan includes?**
```
Yes. Starter includes 10 users, Professional includes 50 users,
Enterprise includes unlimited. If you need more on Starter or
Professional, you can add extra users for €15/user/month. Or upgrade to
the next tier for better value.
```

---

**Q8: What's the difference between hourly sync (Starter) and real-time sync (Professional/Enterprise)?**
```
• Hourly sync: Data refreshes every 60 minutes. Good for most use cases.
• Real-time sync (15-min): Data refreshes every 15 minutes. Better for
  time-sensitive decisions.
• Real-time sync (instant): Data refreshes immediately via webhooks
  (Enterprise only). Critical for operations that need up-to-the-second
  accuracy.
```

---

**Q9: Are there any setup fees or long-term contracts?**
```
No setup fees. Monthly plans have no long-term commitment—cancel anytime.
Annual plans require 12-month commitment but save 17-20%. Enterprise
customers can negotiate multi-year contracts for additional discounts.
```

---

**Q10: What happens to my data if I cancel?**
```
Your data remains accessible for 30 days after cancellation. During this
time, you can export your data or reactivate your account. After 30 days,
your data is permanently deleted from our systems (GDPR compliance). We
never keep your data after account closure.
```

---

**Q11: Do you offer discounts for non-profits or educational institutions?**
```
Yes! We offer 30% off any plan for registered non-profits (501(c)(3) or
equivalent) and educational institutions (.edu domains). Contact sales to
verify eligibility.
```

---

**Q12: Can I get a custom quote for Enterprise?**
```
Yes. Enterprise pricing is flexible based on your needs (number of data
sources, users, storage, support level, deployment type). Contact our
sales team for a custom quote. Companies with 1,000+ employees typically
receive volume discounts.
```

### Section 1: Company Story

**Headline:**
```
We're On a Mission to Democratize Enterprise Data
```

**Story:**
```
UnifyData was born out of frustration.

As a CTO at a 200-person scale-up, our founder spent 10+ hours every week
searching for information across Salesforce, Slack, email, Jira, Notion,
and a dozen other tools. Simple questions—"Which customers mentioned
pricing this quarter?" or "What are our top support issues?"—took hours
or even days to answer.

The irony? We had all the data. We just couldn't access it.

We tried building internal tools. We tried buying "enterprise search"
solutions. Nothing worked. Existing tools only searched documents, not
databases. They didn't connect dots across systems. And they cost a
fortune (per-user pricing is broken).

So in 2024, we built UnifyData—the platform we wished existed.

True data unification. Natural language queries. Affordable pricing. Built
for scale-ups and enterprises who are tired of data silos.

Today, UnifyData serves 500+ companies across 15 countries. We've helped
our customers save 500,000+ hours monthly. We're just getting started.

Join us in making every company data-driven.

### Section 2: Mission, Vision, Values

**Mission:**
```
To democratize enterprise data access by eliminating silos and empowering
every employee to make data-driven decisions through natural language.
```

**Vision:**
```
A world where every company is truly data-driven—where asking a business
question and getting a complete, accurate answer takes seconds, not days.
```

**Core Values:**

**1. Clarity Through Simplicity**
```
Complex data architecture, simple human interaction. We believe powerful
technology should be invisible to the user. If it's not simple, it's not
done.
```

**2. Unified Intelligence**
```
No data left behind. Every source matters, every insight counts. We
connect what others leave fragmented. Complete context, always.
```

**3. Trust & Transparency**
```
Data integrity is non-negotiable. We provide clear lineage, secure access,
and explainable answers. Every fact is verifiable. Trust, but verify.
```

**4. Continuous Evolution**
```
Enterprise needs change daily. We adapt, learn, and improve alongside our
clients. Ship fast, learn faster.
```

**5. Human-First Technology**
```
AI serves people, not the other way around. We build tools that enhance
human decision-making, not replace it. People at the center, always.
```
